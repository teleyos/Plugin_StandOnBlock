# Plugin_StandOnBlock
This is a plugin containing a minigame where you have to stand on blocks.<br />
I compiled it myself so it has the java and class folder alongside.<br />
It's not compressed so you'll have to do it.<br />
It's my first plugin so I hope it's not that bad.<br />

## Version 1.16.1
### Commands
/guidesob to get the guide book<br />
/joingame before a game starts to join it<br />
/givecompass to get The Compass<br />

### The Compass
To use the compass you just right click to launch the game and sneak+right click to end it manually.
